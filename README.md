# Employee-class-in-cpp
Employee class with dynamic name length

This program is just a practice to use classes, we used the employee as an object and its data are variable-length name, id, and salary. we create only one object you can make many as you want or array of it, next few repositories will discuss pointers of structs and class and pointers of classes also.

class and its data:

Here we need to use setters and getters because data is by default is private so to access or retrieve it we need these methods

Then the next important part is constructors it is the only way you can create an object from the class:

Constructors prototype

Stand-alone Functions to fill and print objects of employee:

This code is just a small application on Classes, Constructors, Stand-alone Functions, and a great example on Dynamic allocation (name example).


This code to work on GCC or the new version like Visual Studio or CodeBlocks may need some changes.
